# goblog

This is a simple example Go application based on [Building Web Apps With
Go](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gobridge/building-web-apps-with-go/details) by
Jeremy Saenz [@codegangsta](https://github.com/codegangsta).

The files and folders included are documented here:

```
.
├── README.md       # This file. How meta!
├── main.go         # The main entry point to our application. It boots up the server and listens for requests.
├── posts.go        # Additional types and functions used by main. It is part of this package so it's included automatically.
├── Procfile        # Required by Heroku. It defines how to run our app.
├── public          # A folder of static assets that will be served up directly.
│   ├── app.js      # Our front end code for adding & removing blog posts.
│   ├── favicon.ico # A beautiful favicon image borrowed from golang.org
│   └── index.html  # Our presentation file.
└── vendor          # Third party Go libraries we are using.
    ├── github.com  #
    │   └── ...     # snipped...
    └── vendor.json # A file generated by govendor that describes our dependencies
```

Our Go dependencies are managed with
[govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). If you add or remove a
dependency you should use that tool to update the `vendor/` folder.


## Development

To run this application locally first clone it.

```
go get github.com/jcbwlkr/goblog
```

Then switch to that directory, build the app, and run the executable.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jcbwlkr/goblog
go build
./goblog
```

Your app will then be accessible through your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you change the Go code you must stop the server, rebuild it, and restart it.
You can stop the server with Ctrl-C. You can build and run the file in one step
by doing `go run *.go`.

Alternatively if you want the app to restart itself when you change any `.go`
files you can install [gin](https://github.com/codegangsta/gin) with `go get
github.com/codegangsta/gin` and then building/running the app just requires the
command `gin`. If you do this then your application will, by default, listen on
port 3000 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment

You can easily deploy this app to Heroku. First [create a Heroku account](http://heroku.com).

Next [install the heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com).

Once the toolbelt is installed you must log in from your terminal. Do this with the command

```
heroku login
```

This will prompt you for your Heroku email and password.

Before the first time you deploy this app you must create it on heroku. Ensure
you are in the `goblog` directory in your terminal then run

````
heroku create
```

This will create an application on Heroku and set the git remote url in the local git config.

To deploy run

```
git push heroku master
```

You will see a lot of text scroll by as Heroku builds your app.

To view your app in a browser run

```
heroku open
```

Note that if you see an application error you may need to run a command to
scale up a Heroku dyno. If you get an error try running this and see if it
works


```
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

## Ideas For Improvement

Note that the "database" in this application is just an in-memory slice. Every
time you restart the application it forgets all of your blog posts. To change
this look into using the [database/sql](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql)
package.
